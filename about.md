## Project
#### Human-Computer Chitchat System based on GPT-2  

+ *Deep Learning, DSP, Python*
+ *Autumn 2021*
+ A chitchat system using GPT-2 model for generating chat content.
+ Voice IO and denoise included. Voice output uses ESPNet2 model.
+ GPT-2 model was fine-turned using personal Wechat history data.

#### NLP-based Keyboard \& Mouse Automation System

+ *Machine Learning, NLP, Python*
+ *Winter 2020*
+ A system using Speech Recognition and BOW model that controls keyboard actions and mouse movement just by voice.
+ Keywords extracted from user speech sentences were processed by Bag-OF-Words Model, then encode into basic movements of mouse and keyboard keys.
+ The UI interface was developed by Tkinter. hotkey, movements data load/save are supported.

#### 3D data Visualization Software

+ *C++, QT5, OpenGL*
+ *Autumn 2020*
+ Designed a a Qt-based Software for 3D data visualization, especially for medical data.
+ 3D mesh / point cloud/ Voxel data are supported. Voxel data are rendered using the Marching Cube algorithm.
+ The Voxel rendering is now transplanting into AR device using Unity.

#### Musical Instrument Classification Application

+ *MATLAB, Deep Learning*
+ *Spring 2021*
+ A 5-layer ANN model for musical instrument was trained based on MFCC feature of Instrumentsâ€™ audio dataset.
+ The model was then applied in the software for realtime music instrument classification.
+ Power spectrum and MFCC feature of the music were visualized.

#### Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) System

+ *Analog Circuit Design, Arduino*
+ *Spring 2021*
+ Developed a system that generates bidirectional pulse wave using H-bridge controled by pwm from ESP32.
+ The design was then applied in a cooperation project to evaluate its effect on recovery from exercise fatigue in mice.

#### Head-mounted Night Vision Face Detection System

+ *Raspberry Pi, OpenCV, Multithreading*
+ *Spring 2021*
+ A Night Vision System using infrared leds to fill light at night.
+ Frames are captured, processed and displayed in two individual threads.
+ Face detection is developed with OpenCV.
+ The output frame were finally shown in head mounted screen, though which we could see augmented reality like world.
