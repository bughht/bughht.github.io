+ Electrochemical Sensor: Amperometric glucose Biosensor
  + By measuring the consumption of $O_2$ or the generation of $H_2O_2$, we could indirectly measure the proportion of glucose
  + $$GOD(FAD)+Glucose\rightarrow GOD(FADH_2)+ Glucolactone$$
  + $$GOD(FADH_2)+O_2\rightarrow GOD(FAD)+H_2O_2$$
  + In all: $Glucose+O_2\xrightarrow{GOD} Glucolactone+H_2O_2$
  + 2 methods obtaining electrical signal
    + Using oxygen electrode to measure the exhaust of $O_2$
    + Using Pt as anode, Ag as cathode to measure the production of $H_2O_2$
+ Immunosensor
  + Electrochemical based immunosensor
    + Current based
    + Potential based
    + Capacitance based
    + Conductance based
  + Mass spectrometry based immunosensor
  + Light-induce based immunosensor
    + Principle:
      + special substances $\Rightarrow$ immobilized light-emmiting enzyme $\Rightarrow$ emit photons $\Rightarrow$ photoelectric transducer $\Rightarrow$ electrical signal
    + Structure:
      + Single stranded DNA(ssDNA) probe
        + ssDNA probe immobilize and hybrid with target DNA (cDNA) and produce photons
      + Photoelectric transducer
    + Improvement: Optical fiber DNA immunosensor
      + Equipment:
        + fluorescenced ssDNA probe attached on the end of um-level fiber
        + fluorescence microscope on another end of the fiber
      + Sink the ssDNA probe into solution of target DNA $\Rightarrow$ Immobilization $\Rightarrow$ flourescent probes absorbed layser and emit photons $\Rightarrow$ Flourescence transfer back to the microscope $\Rightarrow$ CCD detect images.
