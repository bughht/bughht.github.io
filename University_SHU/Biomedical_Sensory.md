## Biosensor
+ Structure
  + Input: Substances
  + Biological component on polymer membranes
  + Transducer
    + Covnert physical/chemical changes into measurable electrical signal
    + Types of transducer
      + Electrodes: Oxygen electrode, ammonia electrode, CO2 electrode, pH electrode
      + Photoelectric converter: Photomultiplier tube
      + Thermoelectric converter: Thermistor
      + Semiconducter ISFET: detect the concentration of ions
  + Output: Electrical signal
